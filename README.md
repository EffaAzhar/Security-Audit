# Botium Toys Internal IT Audit

This repository contains the artifacts and documentation related to an internal IT audit conducted at Botium Toys.

**Background**

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

**Audit Scope and Goals**

The IT manager has implemented the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to guide the audit process. The audit scope includes the following areas:

* **IT infrastructure:** Servers, network devices, endpoints, and other IT assets.
* **Applications and data:** Website, e-commerce platform, customer data, and payment processing systems.
* **Security controls:** Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access controls, and other security measures.
* **Policies and procedures:** Data security policies, incident response plans, and other relevant documentation.
* **Compliance:** Compliance with relevant regulations, including PCI DSS and GDPR.

* **Identify and assess risks:** Identify potential risks and vulnerabilities to Botium Toys' critical assets.
* **Determine compliance:** Assess compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

* **Vulnerability assessment:** Identification of weaknesses in the IT infrastructure and systems that could be exploited by threats.
* **Likelihood and impact assessment:** Assessment of the likelihood of each threat occurring and the potential impact on the business.

**Audit Process**
